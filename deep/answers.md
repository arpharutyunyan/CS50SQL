# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Random partitioning is easy to implement and requires minimal management overhead.
Load Balancing can help distribute the workload evenly across boats, especially if observations are collected uniformly throughout the day.
Retrieving specific subsets of data, like observations within a particular time frame, may require querying multiple boats, increasing query complexity.

## Partitioning by Hour

Queries for specific time ranges become more efficient as the data is already partitioned based on time, reducing the number of boats needed to be queried.
If observations are not evenly distributed across different time intervals, certain boats might end up with significantly more data than others, leading to potential performance issues and resource imbalances.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

As the dataset grows, partitioning by hash value allows for easier scaling since new observations can be evenly distributed across existing boats without the need for frequent re-partitioning.
Retrieving specific subsets of data, such as observations within a particular time frame, may require querying multiple boats, increasing query complexity compared to time-based partitioning.
